# Analyzing Employee data with SQL
## Overview of Project
This project is a SQL analysis of a large company's employee data in pgAdmin 4. The company, Pewlett-Hackard, is in the process of migrating their company data into a database with SQL, which takes place during this analysis. The initial datasets imported into pgAdmin 4 were 6 csv files; a spreadsheet of departments, and some employee spreadsheets consisting of hundreds of thousands of rows. From the six initial csv files, 12 new datasets are developed via joins between two or more datasets.
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to design entity relationship diagram (ERD), assigning primary and foreign keys to 6 different employee data csv files imported into pgAdmin 4 in order to design new datasets. The new datasets designed are intended to assist management in determining upcoing company hiring procedures with respect to current expected employee retirement. In some cases, datasets are designed and filtered with respect to company department to satisfy respective department managers. Finally, three datasets are designed to show 1) retiring employees by company position, 2) total retiring employees for each company position, and 3) employees, with thier positions listed, eligible for training new hires.
